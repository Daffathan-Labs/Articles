<h1 class="ql-indent-5"><strong>"The Ambition Is Still There, But It Feels Blunt"</strong></h1>

After the success of the first two films,  
**Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery (2025)** arrives with very high expectations.

Unfortunately, for **me personally**, this one **doesn’t fully deliver**.

It’s not a bad movie —  
but it’s also **not a Knives Out film that truly impressed me**.

**My rating: 6/10.**

# 🕵️‍♂️ Three Key Notes from the Film

## **1. The Pacing Is Too Slow**

This is the most noticeable issue.

The story moves **very slowly**:
- the character introductions drag on,
- the build-up to the murder takes too long,
- the investigation lacks tension,
- and the resolution feels underwhelming.

The **detective vibe doesn’t hit as strongly**.  
Unlike the first *Knives Out* or *Glass Onion*, where every scene felt like an important puzzle piece.

Here?  
Many moments pass by without real suspense or curiosity.

<br>

## **2. The Story Isn’t as Engaging as the First Two**

If I’m being honest:
- *Knives Out* (2019) → smart and solid  
- *Glass Onion* → incredibly fun, sharp satire, great pacing  
- *Wake Up Dead Man* → **safe and somewhat cliché**

The mystery puzzle is **less clever than before**.  
There are twists, but they don’t land hard enough to leave a strong impression.

To me, the film plays it too safe,  
especially when the previous entries were bolder and more creative.

<br>

## **3. A Strong Moral Message (The Biggest Plus)**

One thing that stays consistent across all three films:  
the theme of **people being blinded by wealth**.

Whether it’s:
- inheritance,
- jewels,
- property,
- power,
- or social status,

it always leads to the same conclusion:  
**people are willing to make extreme decisions — even kill — for what they desire**.

The familiar formula remains:
- a closed-circle murder,
- a limited group of suspects,
- wealth as the core motive.

The moral message is still strong and relevant —  
and this is where I can still feel the classic *Knives Out* spirit.

<br>

# 🎬 **Conclusion**

**Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery (2025)** isn’t a bad film,  
but it’s clearly **the weakest entry in the trilogy**.

The film suffers from:
- slow pacing,
- a mystery that lacks sharpness,
- and a missing sense of clever detective brilliance that defined the earlier films.

That said:
- the moral message remains solid,
- the performances are decent,
- and technically, the film is still well made.

If you’re a Knives Out fan,  
this movie is **still worth watching** — just don’t go in with expectations as high as the first two.

Sometimes, even an ambitious mystery can lose its edge.
