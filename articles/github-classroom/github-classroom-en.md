# 🎓 Leaving a Legacy via GitHub Classroom  
## A 1-Semester Experiment at Universitas Pancasila

<img width="585" height="427" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ddb5497-538d-43a0-8fe8-71f384fba01a" />

For **1 semester**, I conducted a small but serious experiment:  
using **GitHub Classroom** as the primary foundation for practicums in **2 classes** at Universitas Pancasila.

This wasn't just about changing tools.  
It was a conscious effort to **leave a legacy** at the place that formed me as a **bachelor (S1)** — a place where I learned not just theory, but a way of thinking.

I'm writing this article as a form of reflection, documentation, and hope.

## 🎯 Why GitHub Classroom?

As a software engineering practitioner, I saw a **huge gap** between:
- what is taught on campus  
- and what is actually used in the industry

GitHub is an **unavoidable tool** in the real world.  
So the question was simple:

> Why aren't informatics students accustomed to it since their college days?

GitHub Classroom answered that.

## 📚 Lessons Learned During 1 Semester

Here are the real lessons I felt firsthand, not just theories.

---

### 1️⃣ Repository Management Becomes Much Easier

Every student:
- has their own repository
- with a consistent structure
- linked directly to the university's GitHub organization

No more:
- random zip files
- weird folder names
- submissions via private group chats

Everything is **centralized, neat, and traceable**.

---

### 2️⃣ Code Evaluation Becomes More Objective

I can see:
- folder structure
- naming consistency
- commit habits
- README quality
- and even their thought process through commit history

Code doesn't lie.  
And this is **much fairer** than just looking at the final output.

---

### 3️⃣ Students are Forced to Learn Git & GitHub (In a Positive Way)

Initially, many were:
- confused
- mistakenly pushing
- encountering conflicts
- even panicking 😄

But after **1 semester**:
- they are accustomed to cloning, committing, pushing, and pulling
- they understand collaboration workflows
- they are no longer strangers to GitHub

This is a significant asset, even before graduation.

---

### 4️⃣ Advanced Material Becomes Logical (CI/CD & Deployment)

Since everything is already on GitHub, I can dive into material that is **rarely touched upon on campus**:
- GitHub Actions
- Simple CI/CD
- automation
- deployment basics

It's not just theory — it's a **real case**.

---

### 5️⃣ I Can Share the True World of a Software Engineer

I can share:
- the reality of working in the Indonesian industry
- international standards
- global engineer expectations
- remote work culture & collaboration

Students get to know:
> "Oh, so this is what the professional world is like."

---

### 6️⃣ Cheating Becomes Almost Impossible

Even if a student gets their friend's repo link:
- they **cannot see its content**
- only the lecturer/assistant and the repo owner have access

This:
- encourages honesty
- forces independent thinking
- improves learning quality

---

### 7️⃣ Student Repositories Become Organized & Archived

All repositories:
- are within the **university GitHub Organization**
- are not scattered
- can be viewed as an academic trail

This isn't just a college assignment, but an **initial portfolio**.

---

### 8️⃣ Assistants are Also Forced to Level Up

It's not just the students.

Assistants:
- inevitably learn Git/GitHub
- understand the workflow
- grow technically alongside the students

The domino effect is palpable.

---

### 9️⃣ Assistants Gain Added Value on Their GitHub Profiles

Being a **member of the university GitHub organization**:
- can be showcased
- adds credibility
- serves as proof of real experience

Small things, but they have an impact.

---

### 🔟 More Adaptive to Technological Advancements

GitHub will continue to be used — today, tomorrow, and years to come.

With GitHub Classroom:
- students aren't shocked by the real world
- the campus doesn't fall behind
- the learning process becomes relevant

---

## 🕌 Values I Hold

All of this is inseparable from the lessons learned at my first workplace.

My first boss practiced a very memorable hadith:

> **"Khoirunnas anfa'uhum linnas"**  
> *The best of people are those who are most beneficial to others.*

That value is what drives me:
- to enjoy sharing knowledge
- not to be stingy with information
- and to want to leave something useful behind

I write this article with that spirit.

## 🧾 Conclusion

The use of **GitHub Classroom** has proven to be:
- extremely beneficial for the academic world
- highly relevant for informatics / computer science
- a bridge between campus and industry

My hope is simple:

> May this become a **good small legacy**,  
> for today's students,  
> and the generations that follow.

Because education is not just about graduating,  
but about **preparing humans who are ready to face the real world**.
