# ☁️ From Backend to Cloud — A Messy Journey That Finally Makes Sense

<img width="800" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07fb78fd-e50e-4284-95b5-56f02b690fb4" />

My career path isn’t clean.  
It’s not linear.  
And honestly — it’s a bit messy.

I never grew up wanting to be a Frontend Developer.  
From the very beginning, my mind leaned toward **backend work**: logic, architecture, data flow, and system-level decisions.

But real-world jobs pulled me in a different direction.  
And ironically, that detour is exactly what shaped my current focus: **DevOps and Cloud Computing**.

This is a candid reflection of that journey —  
not to look impressive, but to explain **why my current direction actually makes sense**.

## 🧑‍🎓 Where It All Started: Vocational School, C++, and Backend Thinking

My journey began in vocational school.

The first language I seriously learned was **C++**.  
Anyone who has worked with C++ knows this well:  
it’s not friendly, but it **forces you to think**.

From there, I moved on to:
- **Java**
- **PHP**

All through an **object-oriented programming** mindset.

Without realizing it, my thinking pattern was shaped:
- understanding execution flow,
- managing state,
- respecting data consistency,
- and valuing structure.

I was comfortable:
- working on the backend,
- designing logic,
- interacting with databases,
- thinking about edge cases.

Even today, this foundation still pays off —  
one of the reasons I landed my current role was my **use of proper database transactions** as a strong plus point.

That backend mindset never disappeared.

## 🏢 First Job: Fullstack on Paper, Frontend in Reality

My first job as a **Web Developer** was in Depok.

Three months of probation.  
Then came the classic question:

> “Do you want to focus on backend or frontend?”

Backend was already crowded.  
I chose **fullstack**.

A logical choice.  
With brutal consequences.

In practice:
- I handled **frontend** most of the time,
- slicing UI,
- managing state,
- UI logic,
- API integration.

As expected, I slowly **fell deep into frontend work**.

Not because of passion at first,  
but because of **responsibility**.

For almost **two years**, I:
- seriously developed my frontend skills,
- understood its ecosystem,
- built discipline around UI and UX.

Frontend taught me a lot about:
- code readability,
- component structure,
- maintainability,
- and communication between layers.

I didn’t abandon backend.  
I **expanded my perspective**.

## 🚀 The Turning Point: Deployment and “This Is Wild”

Everything changed when I was:
- given **deployment access**,
- taught how systems actually run in production.

That’s when it hit me:

> Code is not the finish line.

What truly fascinated me was:
- how systems become accessible online,
- how services communicate with each other,
- how different tech stacks coexist,
- how reliability and availability are maintained.

I started digging into:
- environments,
- servers,
- pipelines,
- configurations,
- and system interactions.

It felt like:
> “Oh… this is what makes everyone else’s code usable.”

That’s when my interest shifted:
- from writing code,
- to **running, maintaining, and scaling systems**.

And that’s where I fell in love with **DevOps**.

## 🤖 The Age of AI Agents: Coding Is No Longer the Bottleneck

Today, we live in a very different era.

Coding:
- can be accelerated,
- assisted,
- even handled by **AI agents**.

This isn’t a threat —  
it’s **reality**.

What differentiates engineers now is no longer:
- typing speed,
- memorizing syntax.

It’s:
- system understanding,
- architectural thinking,
- deployment knowledge,
- reliability awareness.

This is why DevOps and Cloud Computing matter more than ever.

AI can help write code.  
But it:
- **cannot take responsibility for production systems**.

And responsibility is exactly what I want to own.

## ☁️ Looking Forward: DevOps & Cloud Computing

If you draw my path on paper, it looks chaotic:
- Backend → Frontend → Deployment → Cloud.

But if you zoom out, it’s deeply connected.

Today, my focus is clear:
- **DevOps**
- **Cloud Computing**
- **System reliability**
- **Scalable architecture**

Not just for my own career.  
But because I have a bigger goal:

> **To share knowledge with more people, at a larger scale.**

Not only teaching “how to code”,  
but:
- how systems work,
- how engineers should think,
- how to build things that last.

## 🧾 Closing Thoughts

My journey isn’t neat.  
It’s not ideal.  
It’s not textbook.

But through that chaos,  
I found the direction that makes the most sense.

I didn’t abandon my past:
- backend shaped my logic,
- frontend sharpened my discipline and empathy,
- deployment opened my eyes to real-world systems.

And now, I move forward:
**DevOps and Cloud Computing**.

This journey isn’t finished.  
And it shouldn’t be.

Because an engineer who stops learning  
has effectively stopped moving.
