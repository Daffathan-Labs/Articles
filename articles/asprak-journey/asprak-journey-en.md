# 🎓 From Fullstack to the Classroom — Notes on a Teaching Journey and Leaving a Legacy

<img width="1537" height="825" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edu-journey-cover-placeholder" />

This journey didn't start in the classroom.  
It started in the **professional world**.

In **2022**, I first worked as a **Fullstack Engineer**, starting college at the same time without a gap year. Days and nights were filled with code, deadlines, and industry demands. Back then, I never thought I would stand in front of a class and teach.

But everything changed in **2023**.

## 🌱 Semester 3 — First Time Teaching, First Time Feeling "This is Me"

In semester 3, I made a rather bold decision:  
**becoming a Practicum Assistant for Basic Algorithms & Programming**.

This was my **first teaching experience**.

There's one moment that still sticks with me:  
I was teaching while **skipping another course** for an entire full semester😂, because the hours clashed. I was fully aware of the risk — but at that time, I chose **teaching**.

And the students' expressions when they found out…  
their eyes widened. Not out of admiration, but out of wonder:  
> "How can someone choose teaching over attending their own class?"

That's where the **sense of being an educator** emerged.

I enjoyed:
- their expressions when a concept finally "clicked",
- the satisfaction when a simple explanation made an algorithm feel logical,
- the happiness of seeing them **understand**, not just memorize.

It's a feeling that… honestly, is **hard to match**.

### What I Did
- Taught programming basics: data types, variables, control structures, data structures.
- Trained logic and problem solving.
- Provided grading and evaluation for basic algorithms.

## 🧠 Semester 4 — Data Structures and the Challenge of Simplifying the Complex

Entering semester 4, I taught again. This time the material leveled up:  
**Data Structures & Algorithms**.

The challenge here wasn't *what* was taught, but **how to explain it**.

Material like:
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List  

is easy to memorize, but **difficult to understand** if not linked to real-world contexts.

I started asking myself:
> "How can I make this material relevant to the industry?"

So I started:
- linking stacks to the call stack in the backend,
- explaining queues through real-world queuing systems,
- teaching through **live coding**, analogies, and even small games.

My hope was simple:  
if they forget the theory later, the **logic would still remain**.

## 🗄️ Semester 5 — Database, SQL, and Knowledge Too Precious to Miss

In semester 5, I taught **Database Systems**.

My reason was clear and very personal:  
while working as a Software Engineer, I realized **SQL is gold** — but often underestimated on campus.

There are many things rarely touched upon seriously:
- `CASCADE`
- `VIEW`
- `TRANSACTION`
- `GROUP BY` & `HAVING`

Yet in the industry, these are the things that frequently appear.

I didn't want them only to know:
> "SELECT * FROM table"

I wanted them to **understand why a query can be dangerous, expensive, or powerful**.

In this class, I did a lot of:
- one-on-one mentoring,
- dissecting query errors together,
- and explaining databases as the foundation of data science & system design.

## 🌉 Semester 6 — Teaching 50 People, Data Structures, and Life Analogies

In semester 6, I returned to **Data Structures**, but with a **new batch** (batch of 24).

The difference?
- I was much more confident.
- I was bolder in using **everyday life analogies**.
- I even made content for TikTok for the first time, reaching 80,000 views.
- I taught **50 people in one class**.

This wasn't a presentation.  
This was **teaching**.

I explained material like **Graphs** through:
- social media algorithms,
- relationships between users,
- how "we are recommended as friends".

It felt different. Bigger. Heavier. But also more meaningful.

## 🚀 Semester 7 — GitHub Classroom and the Legacy I Want to Leave

In semester 7, I taught **two classes simultaneously**:
- Web Based Programming
- Object Oriented Programming

This is where I made an important decision:  
**using GitHub Classroom**.

This isn't just a tool.  
This is a **legacy**.

The challenge was huge:
- semester 3 & 5 students **had never been taught Git/GitHub**,
- the material is important but often skipped,
- it felt heavy at first.

But gradually:
- they got used to repos,
- started understanding version control,
- learned collaboration,
- and became familiar with industry standards early on.

I realize they might forget my name later.  
But if one day they say:

> "Good thing I was taught GitHub back then…"

That's enough for me.

I hope this becomes:
- long-term preparation,
- knowledge that keeps flowing,
- and hopefully… a **continuing charity (amal jariyah)** that never breaks.

## 🧾 Closing — Teaching is Not About Me, But About Impact

From semester to semester, one thing became increasingly clear to me:

> **Teaching is not about being smart.  
> It's about caring.**

Caring if they understand.  
Caring if the knowledge is relevant.  
Caring if what we teach will be useful after graduation.

I'm not a permanent lecturer.  
I'm nobody.

I'm just someone who has worked in the industry,  
while also going to college,  
and wanted to leave something meaningful behind.

If one day this legacy is still being used,  
then all the fatigue…  
**was worth it.**
