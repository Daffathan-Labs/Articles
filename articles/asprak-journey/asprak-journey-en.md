# 🎓 From Fullstack to the Classroom — Notes on a Teaching Journey and Leaving a Legacy

<img width="720" height="1280" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35c93317-a180-4b89-a935-57657e4cf169" />  

This journey didn't start in a classroom.  
It started in the **professional world**.

In **2022**, I first worked as a **Fullstack Engineer**, while simultaneously starting my university studies without a gap year. My days and nights were filled with code, deadlines, and industrial demands. At that time, it never crossed my mind that I would one day stand in front of a class and teach.

But everything changed in **2023**.

## 🌱 Semester 3 — First Time Teaching, First Time Feeling "This is Me"

<img width="800" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a09bb4e-6261-4081-baa1-081405ca8159" />

In Semester 3, I made a rather bold decision:  
**to become a Laboratory Assistant for Basic Algorithms & Programming**.

This was my **first teaching experience**.

There's one moment that still sticks with me today:  
I was teaching while **skipping another course** for an entire semester😂 because the schedules clashed. I was fully aware of the risks — but at that time, I chose **teaching**.

And the students' expressions when they found out...  
their eyes widened. Not out of admiration, but out of confusion:  
> "How can someone choose teaching over attending their own class?"

That's when the **sense of being an educator** emerged.

I enjoyed:
- their expressions when a concept finally "clicked",
- the satisfaction when a simple explanation made an algorithm feel logical,
- the happiness of seeing them **understand**, not just memorize.

It was a feeling that... honestly, **is hard to match**.

### What I Did
- Taught programming basics: data types, variables, control structures, data structures.
- Trained logic and problem-solving skills.
- Provided assessments and evaluations of basic algorithms.

## 🧠 Semester 4 — Data Structures and the Challenge of Simplifying the Complex

<img width="960" height="1280" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd569434-0607-4bd4-99d3-1ed47727d36a" />

Entering Semester 4, I returned to teaching. This time, the material leveled up:  
**Data Structures & Algorithms**.

The challenge here was no longer *what* to teach, but **how to explain it**.

Topics like:
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List  

are easy to memorize, but **hard to understand** without real-world context.

I started asking myself:
> "How can I make this material relevant to the industry?"

So I began:
- relating stacks to call stacks in the backend,
- explaining queues through real-world queuing systems,
- teaching through **live coding**, analogies, and even small games.

My hope was simple:  
if they ever forget the theory later, **the logic would still remain**.

## 🗄️ Semester 5 — Database, SQL, and Knowledge Too Valuable to Miss

<img width="800" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f9c43b-9f88-425a-bb26-175037a0fcc2" />

In Semester 5, I taught **Database Systems**.

My reason was clear and very personal:  
while working as a Software Engineer, I realized **SQL is gold** — but it's often underestimated on campus.

There are many things rarely touched upon seriously:
- `CASCADE`
- `VIEW`
- `TRANSACTION`
- `GROUP BY` & `HAVING`

Yet in the industry, these are exactly what frequently appear.

I didn't want them to just know:
> "SELECT * FROM table"

I wanted them to **understand why a query can be dangerous, expensive, or powerful**.

In this class, I did a lot of:
- one-on-one mentoring,
- dissecting query errors together,
- and explaining databases as the foundation of data science & system design.

## 🌉 Semester 6 — Teaching 50 Students, Data Structures, and Life Analogies

<img width="800" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76248fb9-aac8-4a75-8292-0073b49c1f1b" />

In Semester 6, I returned to **Data Structures**, but with a **new cohort** (Class of '24).

The difference?
- I was much more confident.
- I was bolder in using **everyday life analogies**.
- I even made my first content for TikTok, reaching 80,000 views.
- I taught **50 people in one class**.

This wasn't just a presentation.  
This was **teaching**.

Topics like **Graphs** were explained through:
- social media algorithms,
- relationships between users,
- how "we are recommended friends".

It felt different. Larger. Heavier. But also more meaningful.

## 🚀 Semester 7 — GitHub Classroom and the Legacy I Want to Leave

![WhatsApp Image 2025-12-19 at 3 38 53 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b4936bc-e73c-4208-b54d-6493faaa8544)

In Semester 7, I taught **two classes simultaneously**:
- Web-Based Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming

This was when I made an important decision:  
**to use GitHub Classroom**.

It wasn't just a tool.  
It was a **legacy**.

The challenge was immense:
- students in Semesters 3 & 5 **had never been taught Git/GitHub before**,
- the material was vital but often skipped,
- it felt overwhelming at first.

But gradually:
- they became accustomed to repositories,
- started understanding version control,
- learned collaboration,
- and got to know industry standards early on.

I realize they might forget my name someday.  
But if one day they say:

> "I'm glad I was taught GitHub back then..."

That would be enough.

I hope this becomes:
- a long-term asset,
- knowledge that keeps flowing,
- and hopefully... a **charity that never ceases (amal jariyah)**.

## 🧾 Closure — Teaching is Not About Me, But About Impact

From semester to semester, one thing has become clearer to me:

> **Teaching isn't about being smart.  
> It's about caring.**

Caring if they understand.  
Caring if this knowledge is relevant.  
Caring if what we teach will be useful after graduation.

I'm not a permanent lecturer.  
I'm nobody.

I'm just someone who has worked in the industry,  
while also being a student,  
and who wants to leave something meaningful behind.

If one day this legacy is still being used,  
then all that exhaustion...  
**was worth it.**
