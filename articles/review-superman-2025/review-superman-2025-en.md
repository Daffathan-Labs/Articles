<h1 class="ql-indent-5"><strong>"This Is Superman"</strong></h1>

On **July 9, 2025**, the *Superman* movie finally officially premiered in Indonesia, immediately capturing the attention of many fans.
This time, Superman arrives with a different tone compared to previous films.

Under the direction of **James Gunn**, the Man of Steel appears more **down-to-earth**, emotional, and full of human touches. No longer portrayed as an untouchable god as in *Man of Steel*, this latest version of Superman attempts to appear as a figure with a heart, feelings, and a longing to be part of humanity in general.

The story is more personal and touching, allowing many viewers to relate to the conflicts Clark Kent faces in a world full of metahumans.

# 🔥 Three Exciting Things from Superman (2025)

## **1. A Symbol of Hope**

One of the strongest elements of this film is how Superman returns to being a **symbol of hope**. He is not just a powerful superhero who can fly, but a real example that:

- kindness matters,
- empathy is valuable,
- and hope is humanity's greatest strength.

James Gunn presents Superman in a warmer and more human way — focusing not just on massive action scenes but also on the emotional side that makes him feel closer to the audience.

## **2. Nicholas Hoult's Stellar Performance as Lex Luthor**

Nicholas Hoult successfully steals the show as **Lex Luthor**. Many were initially skeptical of this casting, but those doubts quickly dissolved upon watching.

Hoult portrays a Luthor who is:

- cold,
- intelligent,
- manipulative,
- yet retains a distinct complexity.

He is not a cliché villain, but a character with true depth and magnetism.

## **3. Minimal Casualties — A Responsible Hero**

One thing that makes this film feel "different" is James Gunn's decision to **avoid showing many casualties**.

Even animals are saved by Superman. This is a breath of fresh air as it demonstrates that:

> a true superhero is not just about power,
> but about caring for the most vulnerable.

This is an approach rarely taken in modern superhero films.


# 🎬 **Conclusion**

**Superman (2025)** is a breath of fresh air in the world of superhero cinema.

The combination of:

- James Gunn's direction,
- mature character writing,
- stunning visuals without losing the heart of the story,
- and strong cast performances

makes this film worth watching more than once.

Superman has returned to being a symbol of hope — just as he should be.
